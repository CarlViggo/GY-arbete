# Project Pipeline
The following code classifies images of lung tumors from the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 data set. The datasets are initially balanced using a General Adversarial Neural Network. 

**Part 1** \\
Random Forests, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors are initially compared to one another. The best model is chosen and evaluated furter. The code for Part 1 is in-house software and therefore not publically availible. 

**Part 2** \\
Dataset is balanced using GAN technology. A pretrained InceptionV3 and a VGG16 are fine-tuned and evaluated.
